 </H1> 
 

 #### To play, you must first select the game mode since it consists of two players and vs cpu, the two player game mode consists of having someone to play with since each one must take their turn to put their token either an X or an O, the game mode vs CPU consists of a type of codes which lets you play alone, for when you're alone or you don't have someone to play with you can be distracted, at the end of both modes there is a winner.      
#### To win this game there must be a three in a row either three XXX or OOO otherwise it will end in a draw

</span>

## **Both modes:** When selecting any of these two modes you will not be able to choose between being X or O.
## **Mode CPU:** Selecting VS CPU mode will always start the player

<H1 align = "center"><span style="color:RED"> POSSIBLE MISTAKES  
</span>

### - Some errors that could happen would be when entering a sign since when entering it the game ends.
### - Another error is when you play against the CPU and it is the CPU's turn and it places it in a box that is already selected. You have to give 4 into for the game to continue and it can happen until someone wins.
### - Possible error not considered: I didn't know whether to take it as an error since when playing vs cpu the cpu is very easy to beat it sounds very silly but it can be related as an error.
